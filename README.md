# [Weather App :zap:](https://github.com/vikas-parmar/weather-app/) 

## Description
:pushpin: Weather app is a web application that allows users to check the weather forecast for a specific location. The app is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and it utilizes modern web development technologies such as CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.  <br />

Users can enter a location in the search bar and the app displays the current weather conditions. The app can also display additional information like wind speed and humidity.

## What I learn from this project
- React Concepts : Components, props, state managment, conditional rendering and event handling.
- API integration: Learn how to fetch data from an external API and use it to populate your app.
- Project management: Learn how to plan, organize, and manage a project from start to finish.

## Optimizations
When I improve this repository, 
- I'm going to add one more component. In that component i will add some logic related to current date, user's location name and the forecast for the next few days.
- I want to improve this App with additional features, like asking users to allow the app to use their device's location for weather forcast.
